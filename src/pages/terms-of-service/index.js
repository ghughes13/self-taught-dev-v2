          our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and
          warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that

          with complete and accurate information and to keep the information
          current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may
          need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our
          Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal
          inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services
          so you can make informed choices in response.

          When you create an account on SelfTaught-dev.com or fill out a form,
          we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services,
          which means that we may also contact you to share more details about
          what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don’t worry — if you aren’t
          interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether
          it’s an email, phone call, or text message.
        </p>

          You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your
          account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of

          Don’t share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us
          immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account or of any other
          breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised,
          we may suspend or disable it.

          websites. So, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We don’t have any control over third-party websites.</li>
          <li>

            that we endorse any third-party website.
          </li>
          <li>
            We don’t endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate,

        </p>
        <h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>
        <h3>a. Automattic Fees</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are
          offered for a fee. By using our service, you agree to pay the
          specified fees. If you sign up for a pro (paid) account, the billing
          will be reoccurring, meaning, we’ll bill or charge you in the
          automatically-renewing interval, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel,
          which you can do at any time by contacting selftdev@gmail.com or going
          to 'Manage Subscription' in the footer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless
          explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable
          federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales,
          value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or
          charges (“Taxes”). You’re responsible for paying all applicable Taxes
          relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your
          purchases. If we’re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees
          you’ve paid or will pay, you’re responsible for those Taxes, and we
          may collect payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails, your membership
          services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example,
          if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse
          the charge of fees for Paid Services), or we suspect a payment is
          fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to our
          services without notice to you.
        </p>
        <p className="important">
          <strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service,
          our services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you
          cancel you membership before the end of the applicable subscription
          period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any
          payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or
          PayPal, or invoice you (in which case payment is due within 15 days)
          to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes.
          By default, your membership will be renewed for the same interval as
          your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a
          one-year subscription to a selftaught-dev.com plan, you’ll be charged
          each year for access for another 12-month period. We may charge your
          account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to
          make sure pesky billing issues don’t inadvertently disrupt your access
          to our Services. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the
          date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you’ve
          purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal
          dates.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for
          selftaught-dev.com services by visiting 'manage subscription' in the
          footer.
        </p>

        <p>
          For any other questions reguarding your subscription or payment,
          please email selftdev@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll need to check your email (including in spam or other filters)
          for any reminder emails we might send you before your services renew.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and
          cancel your membership by going to 'managed services' in the footer.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fees and Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time
          in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law.
          This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging
          fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update
          features or functionality that were previously included in the fees.
          If you don’t agree with the changes, you must cancel your membership.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Refunds.</strong> We may provide refunds at our discresion,
          and we’ll also provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases,
          there are no refunds and all payments are final.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our
          Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you
          agree that we’re free to use them without any restriction or
          compensation to you.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Specific Service Terms</h2>
        <h3>a. SelfTaught-dev.com and memberships</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://selftaught-dev.com/">Selftaught-dev.com</a> aims to
          give you practice projects to help you practice web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          While selftaught-dev.com does have free projects, most of them require
          an active membership to access.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>
        <p>
          As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we
          respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe any
          Content violates your copyright, please notify us at
          selftdev@gmail.com
        </p>
        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Agreement doesn’t transfer any Self Taught Dev or third-party
          intellectual property to you, and all right, title, and interest in
          and to such property remains (as between Automattic and you) solely
          with Self Taught Dev. Self Taught Dev and all other trademarks,
          service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our
          websites or Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Self
          Taught Dev. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used
          in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third
          parties. Using our Services doesn’t grant you any right or license to
          reproduce or otherwise use any Self Taught Dev or third-party
          trademarks.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update, change, or discontinue any aspect of our Services at
          any time. Since we’re constantly updating our Services, we sometimes
          have to change the legal terms under which they’re offered. The
          Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed Garrett
          Hughes, or if Self Taught Dev posts a revised version. We’ll let you
          know when there are changes: we’ll post them here and update the “Last
          Updated” date, and we may also post on one of our blogs or send you an
          email or other communication before the changes become effective. Your
          continued use of our Services after the new terms take effect will be
          subject to the new terms, so if you disagree with the changes in the
          new terms, you should stop using our Services. To the extent you have
          an existing subscription, you may be eligible for a refund.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any
          time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective
          immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our
          sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username due to prolonged
          inactivity, (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our
          Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no
          obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can stop using our Services at any time, or, if you use a
          mebership, you can cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment,
          and Renewal section of these Terms.

          competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising
          under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the
          Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and

          Dallas, Texas, in the English language and the arbitral decision may
          be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or
          proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and
          attorneys’ fees.
        </p>
        <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p className="important">
          In no event will Self Taught Dev, or its suppliers, partners, or
          licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the
          Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other
          legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or
          consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute
          products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or
          corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the
          fees paid by you to Self Taught Dev under the Agreement during the
          twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is
          greater. Self Taught Dev shall have no liability for any failure or
          delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The foregoing
          shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
        </p>
        <h2>15. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Self Taught Dev, its
          contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors,
          officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses,
          liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including
          attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our
          Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement
          or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in
          connection with the Services, Content that you post, and any ecommerce
          activities conducted through your or another user’s website.
        </p>
        <h2>16. US Economic Sanctions</h2>
        <p>

          government authority relating to designated, restricted or prohibited
          persons.

        <p>
          The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to
          any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Self
          Taught Dev and you concerning our Services. If any part of the
          Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable
          from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability
          of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or
          condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance,
          will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
          thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self Taught Dev may assign its rights under the Agreement without
          condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with
          our prior written consent.
